<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>First of all i don't speak English very well, so please excuse me if I say or write wrong. </p>

<p>I consider myself a very curious person of programming language, but because of my anxiety I always said to myself that I will never learn this because I'm not good at English either.
So I wasted so many years telling myself that I'm not gonna learn to program anything or to be able to learn English. Now.. Let me say that I'm still learning both of these and it's not easy at all. But when I start realising that years are passing by, I started questioning myself "Is this the life that I want to live for the rest of my life? Crying and praying for something that it will never happen if I don't do anything?". So I will give this a chance and see how far can I go.

<p> Quick reminder.
  By the time that I write this, I am 27 years old, no job, still living with my parents, and all I can do is to believe in myself that I will achieve this no matter what.
  I am a believer.
